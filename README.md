> Game pitch: Scattered Hanoi is a game developed based on the classic game Tower of Hanoi, you will get a bunch of disks scattered around in an irregular pattern here. All you need to do is put the scattered disks in order on the rightmost stack. You will be rewarded with an extra disk each time you complete, try to collect the disks as much as possible!

> Objective: The object of Scattered Hanoi is to put all the disks on the rightmost stack, players need to move the disks to the rightmost stack by constantly moving and obeying the rule that the big disk cannot be on the small plate. Each time player clears a level, a disk will be added, and the current limit of the game is ten.
